This paper explores the optimal intergovernmental transfer policy when there exists information asymmetry between one central government and multiple local governments. The central government allocates transfers based on observable local output, which is influenced by local private information, output shocks, and endogenous fiscal expenditures. Local governments also leverage their private information to engage in interregional fiscal competition. Theoretically, the optimal transfer policy functions simultaneously as interregional insurance, information rent, and Pigouvian taxation correcting fiscal competition. The information rent is further decomposed into behavioral elasticities and multipliers capturing how the deviation from the IC constraint influences social welfare. Using 2019 Chinese county-level fiscal data, we find that the optimal transfer payment exhibits an inverted U-shape with per capita GDP, emphasizing its roles in providing inter-regional insurance and incentivizing local expenditure efforts. Specifically, we quantify the effects of information asymmetry, local governors' competitive motivations, and economic fluctuations on the optimal transfer policy.
