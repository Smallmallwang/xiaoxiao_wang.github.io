This paper develops a comprehensive framework for optimal income taxation that simultaneously addresses both ability differences and income uncertainty as sources of inequality.  By allowing tax schedules to be contingent on both ability and realized income, we decouple the design problem into distinct moral hazard and adverse selection components, enabling us to characterize the optimal balance between redistribution, insurance, and work incentives. We find several novel findings. First, among workers with identical realized incomes, lower-ability workers face higher marginal tax rates due to incentive effects. Second, workers may experience negative marginal tax rates when facing sufficiently large negative productivity shocks. Finally, our model reveals a lower redistributive effect than standard Mirrlees frameworks, while identifying an incentive effect that increases with ability and raises the ex ante marginal tax rate. These results demonstrate how optimal policy must account for the complex interplay between hidden information and hidden actions when addressing income inequality.
